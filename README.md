# README

This repository contains the sources for documenting the use of `mbari-org/pbp`.

STATUS: Very preliminary.

The generated site from this repo is available at
<https://docs.mbari.org/internal/pbp-doc/>

Initially, the idea is to capture how we have been using PBP in various exercises
performed during the development of PBP itself. 
So, this focus could be maintained as an "internal" document given the various elements
locations that are only internal to MBARI.
Eventually, there would also be a public-facing document that would be more general.
